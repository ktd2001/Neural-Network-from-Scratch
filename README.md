# Neural-Network-from-Scratch

Context:
To demonstrate my knowledge of Neural Networks, I created a Neural Network that trained and tested data without the help of built in Python packages. 

Project:
The Neural Network used dummy data with 5 input features, 2 hidden layers, and 2 output features. Weights and Bias were randomly selected. Feed forward and back propogation algorithms were utilized. The sigmoid and relu activation functions were both tested and gradient descent employed to optimize the SSR value. 

I preferred using sigmoid over relu as it provided more accurate predictions.
